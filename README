asautotest is a tool for non-IDE ActionScript development.

It operates by watching your entire source directory, triggering a
recompilation as soon as any source file changes.  Compilation errors
are reported to the terminal in a nice way.  To keep compilation times
to a minimum, it uses the Flex Compiler Shell (FCSH).

There is also support for automatically running tests after a
successful compilation, but this currently requires some manual glue,
is undocumented and a bit hard to use.  For a working example of the
kind of glue you need, see <test-project/src/specification.as>.

You can install asautotest by simply symlinking it into your PATH:

  $ cd ~/bin ; ln -s ~/asautotest/bin/asautotest.rb asautotest

To get started, you need fcsh, which is part of the Flex SDK.
It should either be in your PATH, or you can set the `FCSH'
environment variable to the location of the `fcsh' executable.
(Unfortunately, symlinking `fcsh' into your PATH may not work; if so,
you will likely end up preferring to set the environment variable.)

Once you have both asautotest and fcsh in place, try this:

  $ cd ~/my-project/src
  $ asautotest main.as

This will compile `main.as' (using `my-project/src' as the source
directory) and then go into sleep, waiting for changes.  As soon as
some `*.as' or `*.mxml' file in <my-project/src> changes, it will wake
up and perform a recompilation.

By default, the resulting SWF is placed in a temporary directory and
then thrown away.  If you want to use the SWF, you need to specify
where it should be placed, using the --output option:

  $ asautotest main.as --output=../bin/my-project.swf

If you have multiple source directores, you need to list them all on
the command line:

  $ cd ~/my-project/src
  $ asautotest main.as . ~/my-other-project/src

Note the `.', specifying the current directory.  Alternatively,

  $ cd ~
  $ asautotest main.as my-project/src my-other-project/src

To link with SWC files, use the --library option:

  $ asautotest main.as --library=../lib/some-library.swc
